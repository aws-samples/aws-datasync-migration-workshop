In this repository you'll find a number of workshops and other resources designed to give you hands-on experience with the AWS DataSync service.  The workshops can be done in any order and have no dependencies on one another.

To run through each workshop, you will need an AWS Account, preferrably with Admin priveleges.  Although the workshops are designed to be self-contained - using CloudFormation templates for easy deployment and cleanup - they should __not__ be run in production accounts.
